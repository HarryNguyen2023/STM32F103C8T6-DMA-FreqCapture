# STM32F103C8T6-DMA-FreqCapture
## Author Harry Nguyen (07/19/2023)

Input capture is a very important module a any modern MCU, which is very useful in calculating the pulse length, in order to measure the pulse frequency, or interfacing with many types of sensors such as ultrasonic sensor, temperature sensor.

All 4 timers on the STM32F103C8T6 provide the input capture capability, with user-defined edge. Therefore, in this project I will use the input capture of TIMER 2 + DMA, to capture the frequency of the PWM pulse generated by the TIMER 3 on the same MCU, and then send the calculated frequency result to the PC via UART.
